== Overview

This document presents the result of insert performance tests run with Apache Ignite v 2.9.1 and PostgreSQL
v 13.1-1. Ignite and PostgreSQL were run with best practice configurations. Nodeinfo table was the target of these measurements. In Ignite, it was partitioned, and these partitions were replicated. In PostgreSQL the table was replicated wholesale.

The tests were run with 10, 20, 30 and 40 threads concurrently inserting 100K, 1M, 2M, 5M, and 10M rows distributed equally among all the threads. Total number of rows were adjusted to the next higher multiple when the sum of per thread rows did not add up to total number of rows.


== Configuration
=== Client
Client AlcorJdbcBenchmark is a standalone Java application run from 10.213.43.161.
Running the client, data collection and creating the plots is documented at the end of this document [section: Running the client].

=== Ignite Cluster
Ignite was configured on 10.213.43.164 as primary and 10.213.43.163 as the replica for the partitions. This is the complete Ignite configuration file
include::./alcor-remote-benchmark-config.xml[].
Nodeinfo table definition
[source, SQL]
drop table if exists nodeinfo;
create table nodeinfo
(
        node_id         VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY,
        node_name       VARCHAR,
        loacl_ip        VARCHAR(40),
        mac_address     VARCHAR(40),
        veth            int,
        host_dvr_mac    VARCHAR(18)
) WITH "template=partitioned";



=== PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL primary is run on 10.213.164 and the replica on 10.213.43.163. This is the complete PostgreSQL configuration file
include::postgresql.conf[].
Nodeinfo table definition
[source, SQL]
drop table if exists nodeinfo;
create table nodeinfo
(
        node_id         VARCHAR(40) PRIMARY KEY,
        node_name       VARCHAR(40),
        local_ip        VARCHAR(40),
        mac_address     VARCHAR(40),
        veth            int,
        host_dvr_mac    VARCHAR(18)
);

== Raw latency data
Latency for each insert has been collected and saved in log files for each run. The tar, gzip version of these log files is in latency-logs/iginie-postgres-insert-latency.log.tar.gz.

=== Comparative latency plots by number of threads
These plots are drawn per thread by varying the number of rows handled by each thread.

=== Conclusion
PostgreSQL is overall better, P95 latency and all other timings being faster by at least 30% in most runs, barring a few abnormalities. Iginte does better than Postgres in 69 out of 200 measurement samples, but even in these cases the standard deviation of latency is better with PostgreSQL (except in two are three cases where PostgreSQL has stalled for a while).
This may be partly due to the fact that Ignite is primarily a KV store exposing a SQL interface while SQL interface is native to PostgreSQL.
Aty the very least, PostgreSQL is not going to degrade performance. If Clustering extensions are used, PostgreSQL is likely to offer better scalability too.

=== Running the benchmark
The benchmark is a self-contained standalone java application. It is invoked by runbm.sh for a single run, or runloop.sh for multiple runs. runbm.sh and runloop.sh accept same command line arguments as the benchmark program itself, but they are slightly more convenient than running the jar file by itself.
runbm.sh provides a help message when invoked with -h command line argument. The benchmark can be used to test any table, and it can generate the data depending based on the table definition.
runbm.sh, runloop.sh, latencyplot2d.sh, makeplot.sh are in scripts directory of the alcor-pref root. Plotting requires GNUplot utility.

=== Syntax of AlcorJdbcBenchmark
[source,text]
    [-h] -d datasource_name [-s schema_file] [-i indelim] [-o outdelim]
    [-n numrec] [-m] [-b batch_size] [-u url] [-U username] [-p password]
    [-N] [-w numworkers] [-u url] [-H hostip ] [-P port] [-D database_name]
    [-v] [tablename1 tablename2 ...]

    -h              : Print the help and exit
    -s schema_file  : contains the table definition (present limitation, one file
                      per table. If absent, looks for <tablenameN>_<datasource>_create_ddl.sql
                      One of schema_file or tablenameN must be supplied.
                      The top three lines specify, column name, types, and sizes
                      name line should be prefixed with --CNL
                      type line should be prefixed with --CTL
                      size line should be prefixed with --CLL
                      types are ALCOR value types if they are not natively supported by
                      the datastore, at present they are:
                       string      -> pure lower case US-ASCII strings, correspond to JSON
                                      string and SQL VARCHAR
                       string(L)   -> pure lower case US-ASCII strings, correspond to JSON
                                      string and SQL CHAR(L)
                       ip          -> Random pick from IPv4 or IPV6 value
                       ipv4        -> IPv4 value
                       ipv6        -> IPv6 value
                       int         -> JSON/SQL integer value
    -i indelim  : input delimiter character on name, type and size lines,
                  defaults to whitespace
    -o outdelim : output delimiter character in generated datafile,
                  defaults to '|'
    -n numrec   : number of data records to generate, defaults to DefNumRecs
    -m          : do not write datafile, drive inserts with in memory records,
                  defaults writing datafile, schema_file with last extension
                  removed and .csv appended
    -b batch_size : Use batch/bulk inserts if supported, defaults to
                    DefBatchSize. Not supported yet
    -u url        : Use url as JDBC connection string, if given, this
                    is used instead of <datasource>/<host>:<port>/dbname
    -U username   : Database usernae, depending on the database, this
                    may be optional
    -p password   : Database user password (like username, conditional)
    -w numWorkers : Number of worker threads
    -N            : No DDL (don't create tables), default false,
                    if given, DELETEs all rows before each run
    -v            : Verbose output
    tablename1 tablename2 ... : read definitions from datasource
                    specific versions, tablenameN-datasource-ddl.sql,
                    or generic tablenameN-ddl.sql, and query from
                    datasource-dml.sql, or query-dml.sql, NOT supported yet

Typically runbm.sh is invoked as follows:
java -cp <classpath for postgres jdbc driver> -m -N -s nodeinfo-postgres-ddl.sql -d postgres -U <username> -p <password> -D <database name> -n 100000 -w 4 -u jdbc:postgresql://<host-ip>:5432/<databasename>

or,

java -cp <classpath for ignite jdbc driver> -s nodeinfo-ignite-ddl.sql -v -d ignite -u jdbc:ignite:thin://<host> -w 2 -n 10000

Send the output to a logfile for post processing and collecting the timings and plotting.

latencyplot2d.sh generates the plots shown in this document, but the latency data needs to be organized by the thread, i.e, collect different database latencies for each thread count into a separate file.
